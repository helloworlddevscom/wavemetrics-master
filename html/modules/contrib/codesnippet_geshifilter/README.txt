CodeSnippet GeSHi Filter
========================

The CodeSnippet GeSHi Filter module acts as a bridge between the CKEditor
CodeSnippet and the GeSHi Filter for syntax highlighting module.

CKEditor CodeSnippet enables content editors to add source code using a
CKEditor popup. It also highlights the source code within the CKEditor
using JavaScript.

GeSHi Filter for syntax highlighting uses the GeSHi (Generic Syntax
Highlighter) PHP library to generate syntax highlighted output on the server
side.

The motivation to creating this module was to ease content editing for
non-technical content editors. It provides an input filter that converts the
output generated by the CKEditor CodeSnippet plugin to output that works well
with the GeSHi filter.

Maintenance notes
=================
This project has been developed for one of our client projects and works
within the scope of our setup. As client project contexts do not necessarily
reflect all possible Drupal setups, we created a development release only.

Please help us testing the module within your setup(s) and feel free to
suggest new features/improvements.

After we find it working with all your environments, we're happy to releasing
a stable version.
